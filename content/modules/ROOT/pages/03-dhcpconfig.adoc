== Dynamic IP configuration with DHCP

The command `+nmcli con+`, short for connection, is an easy way to make
persistent configuration changes to any connection on your network.
Dynamic IP configuration with DHCP is the most common way to configure a
connection, so the first connection you make in this lab will be
dynamic. If you want more information about when to use dynamic
vs. static connections,
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/static-dynamic-ip-1[this article]
provides a great background.

You will configure a dynamic IP connection on *host01*. You will use the
`+nmcli con+` command with some additional arguments to specify that you
want to `+add+` a connection, assign a connection name, choose a network
interface to assign the connection to, and specify the type type of
device the interface uses. Below is an example of this command with each
of the values explained:

.con add breakdown

Run the command to configure this dynamic connection on *host1*:

[source,bash,run]
----
nmcli con add con-name ethernet1 ifname enp7s0 type ethernet
----

You should see a confirmation message similar to

_NOTE:_ NetworkManager will act as the DHCP client when adding a
connection without a specified address.

The advantage of using `+nmcli+` is that configuration changes persist.

Let’s check that the configuration has changed.

[source,bash,run]
----
nmstatectl show enp7s0
----

.nmstatdhcp

Some situations call for an IP that will not change over time, or a
static IP. The next page will walk you through turning this dynamic
connection into a static connection.
