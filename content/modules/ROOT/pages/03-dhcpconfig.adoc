== Dynamic IP configuration with DHCP

The command `+nmcli con+`, short for connection, is an easy way to make
persistent configuration changes to any connection on your network.
Dynamic IP configuration with DHCP is the most common way to configure a
connection, so the first connection you make in this lab will be
dynamic. If you want more information about when to use dynamic
vs. static connections,
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/static-dynamic-ip-1[this article,window=read-later]
provides a great background.

You will configure a dynamic IP connection on *host1*. You will use the
`+nmcli con+` command with some additional arguments to specify that you
want to `+add+` a connection, assign a connection name, choose a network
interface to assign the connection to, and specify the type type of
device the interface uses.

== Add a dynamic connection

.Add a dynamic connection
[%collapsible]
====
Run the command to configure this dynamic connection on *host1*:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con add con-name ethernet1 ifname enp2s0 type ethernet
----

Below is an example of this command with each
of the values explained:

.nmcli Connection commmand explanation

You should see a confirmation message similar to

.Output
[source,text]
----
Connection 'ethernet1' (9957b40e-be3a-4291-b466-e591322aba51) successfully added.
----

NOTE: NetworkManager will act as the DHCP client when adding a
connection without a specified address.

The advantage of using `+nmcli+` is that configuration changes persist.

== Check the configuration

.Check the configuration

====
Let’s check that the configuration has changed.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmstatectl show enp2s0

.Output
[source,text]
----

`nmstatectl` is a tool that can be used to check the configuration of the network interfaces on a system. NMState is a library with an accompanying command line tools that manage host networking settings. NMState is a convenient way to capture network settings into an easily readable yaml file.

Some situations call for an IP that will not change over time, or a static IP. The next page will walk you through turning this dynamic connection into a static connection.
