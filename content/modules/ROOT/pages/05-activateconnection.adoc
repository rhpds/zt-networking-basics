== Activating the connection

The changes weâ€™ve made to the connection `+ethernet1+` have not been
activated.

Run the `+nmcli con up+` command to activate the static connection that
you configured in the previous step:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con up ethernet1
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/7)
----

Run the following to check the ip address and dhcp settings are
correctly configured.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmstatectl show enp2s0 | grep -A 10 ipv4
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
  ipv4:
    enabled: true
    dhcp: false
    address:
    - ip: 192.168.122.110
      prefix-length: 32
  ipv6:
    enabled: true
    dhcp: true
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
----

You can see that the address is configured with `+192.168.122.110/32+`
with `+dhcp+` set to `+false+`, as expected.

Enter the following to check the default gateway.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmstatectl show | grep -A 10 routes
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
routes:
  running:
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    next-hop-interface: eth1
    next-hop-address: 192.168.122.1
    metric: 10
    table-id: 30400
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    next-hop-interface: eth0
    next-hop-address: 192.168.0.1
    metric: 10
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
----

The final step is to learn how to configure the DNS server addresses for
the connection.
