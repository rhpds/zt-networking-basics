== What is NetworkManager?

NetworkManager is a great tool for creating and modifying network
connections. The `+nmcli+` command is how you will be running
NetworkManager in this lab. Any changes made with `+nmcli+` are
persistent configuration file changes. This lab will give you an
overview of some of the most common operations you would run using this
tool.

== Listing network devices

Before you can set up a connection, you have to know what hardware is
available for you to use. To show what network devices this system has
with `+nmcli+`, run

[source,bash,run]
----
nmcli device
----

This will show a list of network interfaces available on the system as
well as how they are configured, similar to the following:

This output shows that there are three devices: *enp1s0* and *enp7s0*
(ethernet devices) as well as *lo* (the loopback device).

Next, you will make your own connection on this host.
