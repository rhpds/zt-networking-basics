== What is nmstate?

NMState is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages
host networking settings. NMState is a convenient way to capture network
settings into an easily readable yaml file.

To install NMState, run the following command in the CLI.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y nmstate
----

.nmstateinstall

Weâ€™ll use NMState later on in this lab.
