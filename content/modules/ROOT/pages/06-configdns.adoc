== Configuring DNS

Now you will add DNS addresses using `+nmcli con modify+`. Visit
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/dns-domain-name-servers[this article,window=read-later] to
learn what DNS is and why it is useful.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con modify ethernet1 ipv4.dns 172.17.0.254
----

This command has no expected output.

This modification will only show up in the proper config file,
`+/etc/resolv.conf+`, once the connection is restarted. This is done the
same way the connection was activated at the start of this lab, using
the `+nmcli con up+` command.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con up ethernet1
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/6)
----

Now you can see these changes reflected in the connectionâ€™s config file:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
grep 'nameserver' /etc/resolv.conf
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
nameserver 192.168.0.2
nameserver 172.17.0.254
----

It is common to want multiple DNS addresses associated with a
connection. You can add multiple DNS addresses by enclosing the set of
addresses in quotes:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con modify ethernet1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
----

This command has no expected output.

As before, restart the connection.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con up ethernet1
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/6)
----

Now the new DNS address shows up in `+resolv.conf+`:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
grep 'nameserver' /etc/resolv.conf
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
nameserver 192.168.0.2
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
----

This is just the surface of what `+nmcli+` can modify. The
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_ip_networking_with_nmcli[Red
Hat Customer Portal,window=read-later] has documentation on the full capabilities of
NetworkManager.
